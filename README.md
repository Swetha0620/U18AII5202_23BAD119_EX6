## Project Overview

This experiment focuses on applying advanced multivariate visualization techniques using R to analyze retail business data. By visualizing relationships between sales and profit while incorporating categorical variables such as customer segment and region, the analysis provides deeper insights into business performance and customer behavior.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset (`6.retail_business.csv`) contains retail business data with the following attributes:

- Sales  
- Profit  
- Customer segment  
- Region  

The data is used to perform multivariate analysis and identify relationships across numerical and categorical variables.

## Software and Tools Used

- **R Programming Language**  
- **RStudio**  

**Libraries Used:**
- `GGally` – multivariate visualization  
- `ggplot2` – advanced plotting  

---

## Steps Performed

1. Loaded the required R libraries (`GGally`, `ggplot2`).  
2. Imported the retail business dataset using `read.csv()`.  
3. Converted categorical variables (Customer Segment and Region) into factors.  
4. Selected numerical variables (Sales and Profit) for multivariate analysis.  
5. Generated a **pairwise scatter plot matrix** using `ggpairs()`.  
6. Applied color encoding for customer segments and shape encoding for regions.  
7. Analyzed patterns and relationships among multiple business variables.  

---

## Visualisation Techniques Implemented

- **Scatter Plot Matrix (ggpairs):** Displays pairwise relationships between Sales and Profit  
- **Color Encoding:** Differentiates customer segments  
- **Shape Encoding:** Represents different regions  
- **Multivariate Analysis:** Combines numerical and categorical variables in a single visualization  

*(The implemented charts are included separately.)*

## Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates the use of advanced multivariate visualization techniques for complex data analysis. By integrating sales, profit, customer segment, and region into a single analytical view, meaningful patterns and relationships can be identified that support strategic decision-making in retail business analytics.
